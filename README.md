# Rapid serial visual presentation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation

This small script just takes the piped standard input and displays it in a
rapid serial visual fashion, then closes it's own window.

features I'll add at some point:
- pause
- variable schedule according to length of word so that longer words are on screen a tiny bit longer

Requirements:
- kivy
